    Hey guys, just for the meeting today a quick heads up. 
    We had a meeting yesterday with Maxxon, who develop our new motor for our skateboards. 
    They said we should talk about their newly developed Motor R200. 
    Also don't forget that today we have a meeting with Munich Woodworks at 3:00 PM 
    I have set you guys an outlook calendar entry. 
    and another Teams call with our axle company which is at, I think, 4:00 AM. 
    Also, don't forget in one week our sustainability report is due. 
    Yeah, I think that's all I wanted to say I guess. Yep, have a great day.

    Hey Rick, I have to tell you about my holiday in Canada. 
    You won't believe how close we were to death. 
    First we had a 5 day hiking trip on Vancouver Island on the West Coast trail where we 
    just had to live out of our bags and walked 400 km along the coast. Then we even saw a bear! 
    I have to end now, but I will tell you the whole story later.

    Yesterday we had a awesome boat cruise through the inside passage where we saw whales. 
    You won't believe it how funny it was to see the tourists hunting for photos of whales.
    \nI don't want to make this message to long but one last story. 
    We went on a 3 day hike at the Kluane lake. But we got completely lost 
    because there were no real trails and we only had a small map.
    \nMy girlfriend did not have her glasses on so she thought all the time that 
    she saw a bear everywhere.\n###\nSemantic Category: 2) A General conversation.

    Good morning, I hope you slept well. I just realized I have only the weekends to meet up. 
    I do have uni starting today and also. 
    Some events for the makeathon are online, like some talks tonight and some quizzes. 
    Those kind of team building things. 
    But you know, I'm sure I have time. 
    If you have time, if not, next week is also good. 
    I am off now to work training. 
    I said I'd be there at 8:30, but yeah, it's pretty casual since he's not paying me for 
    today and training should be paid in my opinion. 
    So I'm going to walk up there when I want an and then come back and then 12:00 PM 
    I start with programming class and then at 2:30 with Bulgarian II. 
    And which I'm super excited for and I looked at the textbook and like I can read it and understand it already. 
    So you know, I think it will be just in slightly modifying and my knowledge of Macedonian 
    into knowledge of Bulgarian, which is important because last time I went to Sofia 
    they kept correcting me because they didn't realize that I was speaking Macedonian.
